However, his time in major league baseball wasn't very happy for him. A young, shy man from a wealthy family, Shafer was hassled from the moment he first entered the Giants' clubhouse as a rookie. Outfielder Cy Seymour gave him the feminine nickname Tillie, which stuck. Throughout his tenure in New York, Shafer was branded as a "momma's boy" and razzed by his teammates.

After two seasons of sitting on the bench, Shafer took 1911 off to go home and also to play baseball in Japan. He returned the following season, and in 1913, he was a regular in the Giants' starting line-up for the first time. He got to play in the 1912 and 1913 World Series.

Walker was born in Stepney, London the son of a brewery worker. He attended the Jubilee School in Bedford, Essex, leaving at 14 to work in an aircraft factory. He later worked as a salesman in Billingsgate Fish Market and did his National Service in the Royal Air Force. Walker was a keen amateur boxer becoming British amateur heavyweight champion in 1951. He turned professional and fought 14 professional fights winning 11 with eight knockouts. Walker then drifted into crime, working for East End gangster, Billy Hill, and eventually being convicted for theft and serving two and a half years in Wormwood Scrubs.

On release he became the owner of a motor garage and manager for his brother, Billy Walker a professional heavyweight boxer. Walker launched London's first discothèque, Dolly's in Jermyn Street, and a chain of cafes, Billy's Baked Potato, with his brother.

In 1974 Walker took over the Hackney & Hendon Greyhounds Co and merged it with his interests to form Brent Walker. The company developed the Brent Cross shopping centre on the site of an old greyhound racing track. Walker sold his equity in Brent Cross in 1979 netting £3.7 million in profit.

Brent Walker had a turbulent career through the 1980s, being worth about 250 million pounds at its zenith but eventually collapsing in 1990 after taking over William Hill Bookmakers in a leveraged buy out. Walker was accused of fraud after an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office but was cleared of all charges after a lengthy trial in 1995. He was however made bankrupt and moved to Russia where he ran a series of businesses selling cigarettes and perfume and later opening a chain of betting shops.

Walker was married to Jean Maureen Hatton who he knew since he was 16 years old. They had two daughters and a son. Sarah Walker, their eldest daughter, married George Mountbatten, 4th Marquess of Milford Haven.
