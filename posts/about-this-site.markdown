Here's a quick first post about why I made the site and what it's all about. I'm guessing this will be read by no one as there isn't anything else useful on the site to be Googled!

### What's it for?

I made this site for two reasons. One. Everyone seems to have a blog nowadays and I thought I'd jump on the bandwagon. Better late than never! Two. I'm planning on post in all the crap I do on here so I don't forget it. Had to set something up on my VPS? Write it down here. Tricky bit of code to write? Stick it here. That's the plan anyway!

I expect posts will be few and far between (and a lot better) as this isn't my full time job. Coding is just a hobby (for now).

### Under the hood

Custom built with [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com) and [JADOF](https://github.com/remi/jadof) running the show. Comments tacked on the end by [DISQUS](http://disqus.com) and the whole thing stuck on [github](https://github.com/fatnic/codebiff) for the whole world to see. I might write a post on how I made it one day. All hosted by the lovely [VPS.net](http://vps.net).

### On the surface

Background from [Subtle Patterns](http://subtlepatterns.com/?p=449). Social media icons by [Somicro](http://vervex.deviantart.com/art/Somicro-27-Social-Media-Icons-257232757). Small icons by [Yusuke Kamiyamane](http://p.yusukekamiyamane.com/). Lemon image from [Graphicpeel](http://graphicpeel.com/icons).

### Software used

Designed in the browser with Google Chrome. Gash images thrown together with Photoshop. Coded in VIM and posts written in Markdown with [ReText](http://sourceforge.net/p/retext/home/ReText/). All done on a shitty 5 year old laptop running Ubuntu. Any donations towards a new MacBook would be appreciated. 


### The future...

... well I better read up on how to write a decent blog post!
