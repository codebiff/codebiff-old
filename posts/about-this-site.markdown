Here's a quick first post about why I made the site and what it's all about.

### What's it for?

I made this site for two reasons. One. Everyone seems to have a blog nowadays and I thought I'd jump on the bandwagon. Better late than never! Two. I'm planning on post in all the crap I do on here so I don't forget it. Had to set something up on my VPS? Write it down here. Tricky bit of code to write? Stick it here. That's the plan anyway!

### Under the hood

Custom built with [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com) and [JADOF](https://github.com/remi/jadof) running the show. Comments tacked on the end by [DISQUS](http://disqus.com) and the whole thing stuck on [github](https://github.com/fatnic/codebiff) for the whole world to see. I might write a post on how I made it one day.

### On the surface

Background from [Subtle Patterns](http://subtlepatterns.com/?p=449). Social media icons by [Somicro](http://vervex.deviantart.com/art/Somicro-27-Social-Media-Icons-257232757). Small icons by [Yusuke Kamiyamane](http://p.yusukekamiyamane.com/). Lemon image from [Graphicpeel](http://graphicpeel.com/icons).

### The future...

... we'll see.
