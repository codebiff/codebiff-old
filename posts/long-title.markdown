George Fitzgerald Smoot III (born February 20, 1945) is an American astrophysicist, cosmologist, Nobel laureate, and $1 million TV quiz show prize winner (Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?). He won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2006 for his work on COBE with John C.Mather that led to the measurement "of the black body form and anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation."

This work helped further the big-bang theory of the universe using the Cosmic Background Explorer Satellite (COBE).[2] According to the Nobel Prize committee, "the COBE project can also be regarded as the starting point for cosmology as a precision science."[3] Smoot donated his share of the Nobel Prize money, less travel costs, to a charitable foundation.[4]

Currently he is a professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley, senior scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and since 2010, a professor of physics at the Paris Diderot University, France. In 2003, he was awarded the Einstein Medal.
